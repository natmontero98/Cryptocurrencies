# Cryptocurrencies

Accountability Accounting, an investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers but they're not very up to date with how cryptocurrencies work.
The purpose of this project was to help Martha, the manager for the Advisory Services Team, with an analysis of a cryptocurrencies databased to understand them better. For this we used an unsupervised machine learning model that allows us to know what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
